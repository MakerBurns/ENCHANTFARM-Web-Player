Greetings, and thank you for downloading another
entry in the /vrpg/ Exclusives collection.

Please run the game using either the start.exe or
start_window.exe files included in here. Alternatively,
you may choose to run the RPG_RT.exe in the game folder
directly. As a final alternative, this game is fully
compatible with EasyRPG which can be downloaded at the
following link:

https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/

Simply download the player that works for your system
and drop it into the game folder, then run EasyRPG.exe
directly.

Enchant Farm is largely considered one of the top VIPRPG
JRPGs in terms of sheer gameplay and dominated forums
for the latter half of the 2010s where RPG Maker games
are discussed in Japanese circles. It is my hope that
you enjoy this game as much as they did, and indeed,
as much as I have enjoyed it.

If you spot any typos or feel that something has been
translated incorrectly, please feel free to go to the
/vrpg/ board of 4channel.org and find any RPG Maker
thread, then simply make a post about it there, and
attach a screenshot of the issue. For translation
issues in particular, if at all possible, please
provide a compelling argument why my translation was
incorrect/poor, and suggest a correction.

If you encounter any bugs, crashes, or other issues
that hinder your enjoyment of the game, please do
the same described above.
