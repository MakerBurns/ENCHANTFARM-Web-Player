***The following is a translation of a readme
left behind by Kiito, the game's creator.***
-------------------------------------------
In the event you are using an external loader
such as RPG Tkool Loader, please extract the game
from its 7zip/rar/zip. Playing this game while
the game is compressed may cause it to run poorly
depending on your system.

I was unable to find time to test play each and
every main character.
There may be times when the characters' dialogue
might seem strange, unnatural, unusual, or inconsistent.
For this, I apologize and ask that you skip it.
I would like to implement a way to autoskip text soon,
if possible.
(The character with the most consistent dialogue is
probably Darkness I, I think.)
